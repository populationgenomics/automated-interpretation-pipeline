"""
Takes an input MT, and extracts a VCF-format representation.

This is currently required as the end-to-end CPG pipeline doesn't currently
store intermediate files. To simulate workflows running on VCF files, we
have to regenerate a VCF representation from a MT.

Hard coded additional header file for VQSR content
When Hail extracts a VCF from a MT, it doesn't contain any custom field
definitions, e.g. 'VQSR' as a Filter field. This argument allows us to
specify additional lines which are required to make the final output valid
within the VCF specification

If the file was not processed with VQSR, there are no negatives to including
this additional header line
